# Apes of Wrath Website Project

This project was commissioned by my highschool robotics team in order to revamp our previous website. After taking over as the lead web captain of the team, I decided to create a dedicated website using HTML, CSS, and JS. While many of the features were taken from the previous website, I made sure to add in some features of my own.

While the original [Robotics-Website-Milestone-1](https://github.com/CKhamis/Robotics-Website-Milestone-1) website was actually released to the public, this website was a fork that begun implementation of various new features that were not yet finished.
## Account System & Dashboard
This project featured a brand new login and dashboard screens that were meant to centralize team priorities for each sub team. While I did not yet have a backend implementation, I continued developing this idea to see how it would work

## Easter Eggs
Another idea I implemented into this version was multiple Easter eggs hidden in the UI. For example, I embedded a simple snake game into the error 404 screen.
